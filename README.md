\# ‚öôÔ∏è Ball Balancing Robot ‚Äì STM32 Blue Pill



This repository contains only the \*\*STM32 firmware\*\* for the ball balancing robot.  

It implements real-time control, PID stabilization, and inverse kinematics logic.  

The \*\*mechanical structure\*\* and \*\*computer vision system\*\* are developed separately and are \*\*not included here\*\*.

\## üß† Project Overview



The system aims to balance a ball on a flat platform using three servo motors.  

The STM32 Blue Pill receives the ball‚Äôs coordinates (X, Y) from an external computer vision module via USB.  

Then it calculates the required platform tilt using:

\- \*\*PID Control\*\* ‚Äì to minimize the distance between the ball and the center.

\- \*\*Inverse Kinematics\*\* ‚Äì to determine each servo‚Äôs target angle.

\- \*\*PWM Output\*\* ‚Äì to drive the servos precisely in real time.



The STM32 runs the full control logic independently.

\## üß∞ How to Run the Project



All STM32 source codes are already uploaded above and ready to use.  

If you want to explore or modify the control logic, you can open the source files directly.  



For those who prefer to test the full project in STM32CubeIDE without manual setup,  

a \*\*ZIP file\*\* containing the complete, ready-to-run project is also included in this repository.



Simply download the ZIP file, extract it, and open the project in STM32CubeIDE.

\## üß™ Expected Behavior



\- When the ball is detected, the platform tilts to push it toward the center.  

\- When no ball is detected, servos return to default neutral angles.  

\- The system continuously runs in real time, updating every ~20 ms.
